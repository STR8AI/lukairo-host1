# Copilot Coding Agent Instructions for This Repository

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository powers the LUKAIRO front-end experience, including:
- Hero section with interactive 3D globe (Three.js)
- Landing pages and UI components
- CSS animations, branding, and responsive layout
- Integration points for backend services and API endpoints
- Build and deploy pipeline for Cloudflare Pages

The Copilot Agent should prioritize:
- Clean, modular front-end code
- Maintainability and readability
- Strong performance for 3D assets and animations
- SEO-ready HTML metadata
- Smooth Cloudflare Pages deployments

## Coding Style & Guidelines

### JavaScript / Three.js
- Use ES modules.
- Keep scene setup modular (`scene.js`, `globe.js`, `interactions.js`).
- Avoid global variables unless needed for performance.
- Use requestAnimationFrame loops with lightweight tick functions.
- Always enable `renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace`.
- Prefer GPU-efficient materials and geometries.

### HTML / CSS
- Use semantic HTML5 structure.
- Keep CSS in component-scoped files when possible.
- Use CSS variables for theme consistency.
- Prefer flex/grid layout.
- Optimize for mobile and high DPI screens.

### Build / Repo Structure
- Keep `/public` for static assets.
- Keep `/src` for components, scripts, modules.
- Keep `/styles` for global & component CSS.
- Use `/components` for reusable UI blocks.

---

## Commit Expectations
The Copilot Agent should:
- Propose atomic commits.
- Provide diff-based changes only.
- Avoid rewriting entire files unless explicitly required.
- Follow existing stylistic patterns.

---

## Pull Requests
Every PR generated by Copilot should include:
1. **Summary of changes**
2. **Why the change was needed**
3. **How it impacts performance/UX**
4. **Testing notes**

---

## DevOps / Deployment Notes
- Builds auto-deploy to Cloudflare Pages on `main`.
- Ensure changes do not break the deployment pipeline.
- Keep assets lightweight for fast CDN delivery.

---

## Security
- Never commit secrets or environment variables.
- Use placeholders for keys.
- Validate user input in all forms & handlers.

---

## When Copilot Should Ask for Clarification
The agent MUST request clarification when:
- Requirements conflict.
- A file is missing and context is unclear.
- The requested change affects build tooling or DNS config.

Otherwise, default to: **execute — don’t over-explain**.

---

## Allowed Autonomy Level
The agent is allowed to:
- Create new files
- Refactor existing code
- Add documentation
- Improve performance or structure

The agent is NOT allowed to:
- Delete major components unless instructed
- Change product branding
- Modify deployment settings without approval

---

## Style Preferences
- Direct, clean code — no fluff.
- Minimal inline comments; use docblocks for modules.
- Prefer constants over magic numbers.
- If code can be simplified, simplify it.
