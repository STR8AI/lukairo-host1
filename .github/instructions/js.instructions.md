# JavaScript Guidelines

- Use ES6+ syntax (const, let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Avoid using `var`
- Use strict equality (`===` and `!==`)
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors appropriately with try/catch
- Use passive event listeners for scroll and touch events
- Cache DOM queries to avoid repeated lookups
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for animations
